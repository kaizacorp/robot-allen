# robot-allen

Want a Library of Allenxandria gif but don't know which one? Let Robot Allen decide for you!

Commands include:

`!gif` to randomly choose an Allen gif (using Tenor) or `!gif term1 term2 ...` to search for an Allen gif with the given terms.

`!tbr option1 option2 ...` to have Robot Allen choose what you should read next (titles with spaces can be used with quotes)



Add Robot Allen to your Discord server by using this link:

The bot currently runs on all channels. This is my first Discord bot so please bear with me.

If you have any ideas/bugs/issues please create an issue here or message me @KaizaCorp#6992 on Discord to let me know! 

**TODO:**

+ Properly sanitize inputs for dealing with mixtures of quote types for `!tbr` (both types of double quotes working, but not single quotes currently)
+ Implement handling `!tbr <goodreads shelf URL>` and reply with book cover image.
